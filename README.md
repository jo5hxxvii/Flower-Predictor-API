# Flower-Prediction-API
 Using FastAPI to Deploy a Machine Learning Model for usage.

 The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to deploy a Machine learning model using FastAPI.

 A Logistic Regression model was trained on the popular Iris Dataset and Exported using Pickle.
 Note: The accuracy of the model is of no relevance to this project as the focus is on the deployment.
